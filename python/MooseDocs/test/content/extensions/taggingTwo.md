# Tagging Extension (Second Test Page)

!tag name=tagging_two    application:test_two foo:bas simulation_type_wrong:warning fiscal_year:2024

This page tests the usage of the following tagging extension syntax:

```
!tag name=tagging_two    application:test_two foo:bas simulation_type_wrong:warning fiscal_year:2024
```

This syntax tests for the allowance of extra spaces between the 'name' identifier and key:value
pairs as well as generates a warning for a key that differs from the allowed list.
