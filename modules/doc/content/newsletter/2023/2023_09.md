## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

## PETSc-level Changes

### PETSc updated to 3.19.3: new conda packages

The `moose-petsc` package has been updated alongside the repository submodule to 3.19.3 -
specifically, a pre-release version (3.19.3-884-g08c1f94318e). As a result of this change, `moose-mpich`
required a new pinned dependency, GNU `bison` version 3.4. Subsequently, all conda packages have been
incremented and should be updated.

To update your MOOSE packages, please activate your MOOSE conda environment and
perform the command:

```
mamba update --all
```

The following package versions and builds outlined in the update prompt should be
at least the following:

```
